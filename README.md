# Welcome to the DBC project

DBC is a free and open source database that aims at providing high reliability and efficiency.

I have just finished the basic and prototype of this database system. Many functions remain to be implemented(more details are located at the to do list in Wiki) and some design may need to be changed to make the system work better. I hope you can join me if you are interested in it.
